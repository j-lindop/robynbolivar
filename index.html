            <p>My work with clients is relational, collaborative, trauma-informed and grounded in anti-oppression. Our work together will be influenced by adult attachment theory. I have worked in the Violence Against Women, HIV/AIDS, LGBTQ+ and Sexual and Reproductive Health movements. I have dedicated over twenty years of my life talking about sex, sexuality and healthy relationships.</p>

               <h2>Couples</h2>
               <p>I practice Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) with couples. I help couples move away from disconnection towards a stronger and secure bond. Security regains emotional balance so your relationship will start to feel less chaotic and more connected. I have been privileged to bear witness to the results; couples have said our work together reduced their conflicts and improved their communication. We will work to uncover your unspoken or unmet needs and create a space for your partner to take in the importance of what you need to say.</p>
               <p>My goal for couplesâ€™ work is to see individuals start to feel secure in their relationship by learning to lean on their partners for comfort, and for this love to be returned in a responsive and accessible way. In session, clients have an opportunity to learn how to communicate differently with one another.</p>

               <h2>Non-monogamous or Polyamouious</h2>
               <p>I strongly believe safety and security can be found, or reinstated, in not only monogamous arrangements. I support couples, who identify as polyamorous or non-monogamous or who might want to explore a new relationship structure outside of monogamy. We will focus on the relationship in the room. When two people start to feel more valued and connected together the other issues which may arise regarding non-monogamy can be much easier to work though both in and outside of the therapy room.</p>

               <h2>Individuals</h2>
               <p>With individuals, I practice Emotionally Focused Therapy, however, my practice remains more eclectic as I also use aspects of Mindfulness, Solution Focused, Narrative Therapy as well as other modalities.</p>
               <p>I am interactive in session, and may draw on psycho-education to help you better understand how the brain and nervous systems work. I believe people are curious; we can work together to help you make sense of your behaviour and choices. We would work at your pace only exploring what you wish to consider.</p>
               <p>Many individuals come to me to talk about their intimate relationships. I truly enjoy supporting people through the awareness of their disowned needs so that these needs can be expressed to their partners in a vulnerable way. Getting the love you want requires vulnerable communication about self, as goes approaching conflict in a less destructive way. I also support individuals through the grief of love lost.</p>

               <h2>Sex Therapy</h2>
               <p>I also offer sex therapy to my clients, both individuals and couples. Primarily, my focus has been on desire and subsequently, pleasure. Clients come to me with a full range of concerns regarding their sex lives and sexual relationships. My background as a Sexual Health Educator and Counsellor fits well with the therapeutic approach I offer. So much about sex and sexuality is masked in misconceptions. Knowledge is empowering when it comes to a lack of sexual desire or performance concerns. Together we explore the dynamics in relationship(s) and your own wants and/or preoccupations to understand if they contribute to your sexual concerns as a couple, or as an individual.</p>
               <p>When I require consulting on clients receiving sex therapy, I meet with a Registered Sex Therapist and Supervisor who is a member of The Board of Examiners in Sex Therapy and Counselling in Ontario (BESTCO), which I am also in the process of joining.</p>
